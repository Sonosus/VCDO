This was originally going to be a triple oscillator module, but there's too much functionality that would be left out by squeezing 3 of these into one 15cm panel.
I will pair this with my Kosmic Superspreader module to add a 'Spread' control when using 3 of these modules.
Work in progress, not verified, it might combust.
